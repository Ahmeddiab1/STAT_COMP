# Variable screening methods


Sure Independence Screening (SIS)

Fan and Lv (2008) introduced the concept of sure screening and proposed a sure screening method, Sure Independence Screening (SIS), to reduce dimensionality from high to a relatively large scale d thatis below sample size. 

In a fairly general asymptotic framework, SIS is shown to have the sure screening property for even exponentially growing dimension.
