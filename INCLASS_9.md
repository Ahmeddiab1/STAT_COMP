### Model Comparison using AIC/BIC/Adjusted R-2 and out-of-sample prediction R-sq.



Consider these two competing hypotheses:   H1: `Wage~Sex+Education+Experience`, H2: `Wage~.`


  - Fit the two models to the full data set, obtain R-sq., adjusted R-sq., AIC, BIC and a p-value from an F-test.
  - Conduct 1000 training-testing evaluations (nTesting=150) to estimate prediciton R-sq. for H1 and H2.
  - Report a table with AIC,BIC,Training R-sq., Training adj-Rsq. and prediction r-sq. for each of the models.
  - Which model do you choose? Why?
