In-class assigment 7

Using the following simulation

Fit step-functions with 2, 4, 6,...,20 bins (DF) and, for each model evaluate:

   - Model R-squared `summary(fm)$r.squared`
   - Model adjusted R-sq. `summary(fm)$adj.r.squared`
   - AIC  `AIC(fm)`
   - BIC  `BIC(fm)`
 
Report a table with models in rows, model DF, and each of the above criteria in columns.
