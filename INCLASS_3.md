Inclass-assigment 3 (Due in D2L, Oct. 28th).

   1) Modify the example discussed in class today to produce estimatews of rejection rate for `N=[10,20,30,50,100,200]` and `R2=[0,.01,.03,.05,.1,.2]`.
   2) Report a table with N in rows, R2 in columns and estiamted rejection rate in the body.
   3) Produce a plot with Rejection rate in the y-axis, R2 in the x-axis and curves by sample size.
   4) What is the estimated type-I error rate for each of the sample sizes considered?
