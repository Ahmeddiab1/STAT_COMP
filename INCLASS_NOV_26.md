Suppose X and Y are two Bernoulli Random Variables with the following joint distribution:

|   | X=0 | X=1 |
|----|-----|---|
|Y=0 | 0.2 | 0.1 |
| Y=1 | 0.1 | 0.6 |

Task: Generate 1000 random samples from the above distribution using composition sampling.

Report a table with the empirical fequencies for each of the possible outcomes, that is (X=0,Y=0), 
(X=0,Y=1), (X=1,Y=0) and (X=1,Y=1).
